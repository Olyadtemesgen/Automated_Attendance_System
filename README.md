# Automated Attendance System

## Overview

The Automated Attendance System streamlines attendance tracking using facial recognition and machine learning. The system comprises a Flutter-based frontend, a Flask-powered backend, and leverages OpenCV, face_recognition, TensorFlow, and Keras for facial recognition and machine learning.

## Components

### 1. Frontend (Flutter)

- Create a natively compiled application for mobile, web, and desktop platforms with a single codebase.
- Ensure a consistent user experience across different devices.

### 2. Backend (Flask)

- Develop a robust API for communication between the frontend and backend server.
- Handle image upload, model training, and attendance tracking.

### 3. Facial Recognition (OpenCV and face_recognition)

- Utilize OpenCV and face_recognition libraries for accurate and efficient face detection and recognition.

### 4. Machine Learning Model (TensorFlow/Keras)

- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras for facial recognition.

## Usage

1. **Frontend Interaction:**
   - Users upload images through the Flutter application.

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Flask processes image data, detects faces, and performs facial recognition.

3. **Facial Recognition:**
   - OpenCV and face_recognition libraries identify faces.
   - A trained machine learning model matches detected faces.

4. **Attendance Tracking:**
   - The system records attendance based on recognized faces.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
